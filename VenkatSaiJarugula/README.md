### 
Google Page Rank Project

For testing my  Google Page Rank Project I have used the sample files discussed in the class.
I have files README.md, java.md, go.md and python.md with links referencing each other in my web04 folder.
By running the above project I came to know README.md is the highly ranked page among all the pages in the web04 folder


### Execution Command

mvn compile exec:java -D exec.mainClass=edu.nwmissouri.sec02group03.jarugula.MinimalPageRankJarugula
